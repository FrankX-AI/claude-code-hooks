## What Are Hooks?

Claude Code hooks are shell scripts and Node.js modules that run automatically during AI coding sessions. They intercept lifecycle events — before edits, after tool calls, on session start/stop — giving you control over quality, safety, and intelligence.

Supports the full 5-harness fleet + grok-personal excellence layer (the 4 .grok-native seeds + personal-creative per claude-code-config/SHARING.md). Excellence gates (quality-gate, pre-compact) enforce Frank DNA + rules first + core vs grok-personal/personal-creative partition. Portable across Claude, Grok TUI, agy, gemini. See SHARING.md for the "a bit magical, not for everything" discipline.

```
You edit a file → Quality Gate checks token compliance → PASS → Edit proceeds
You edit a file → Quality Gate detects hardcoded color → BLOCK → Suggests token
```

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frankxai/claude-code-hooks.git
cd claude-code-hooks
./install.sh
```

Or copy individual hooks to your `.claude/hooks/` directory.

**Multi-harness / Grok support:** `./install.sh --multi` or `--portable` seeds for claude/codex/gemini/agy/grok (via hook-env detection). For Grok, also seeds `~/.grok/hooks/*.json` for native SessionStart/PreToolUse excellence gates (Kenya-magical per SHARING.md + SIP §5: the excellence hooks stay sovereign in .grok/ only; core hooks portable to all). Kenya magical (Grok .grok excellence tuned for TUI/subagents/MCP/image + personal) not shared to ACOS core.

## The Hooks

`hooks/` ships ~30 files: most lifecycle hooks are a thin portable `.sh` wrapper (sources `hooks/lib/hook-env.sh` for multi-harness detection) backing onto a `.js`/`.ts` file with the real logic. `settings-example.json` is the canonical wired set — 15 hook registrations across 8 lifecycle events:

### Lifecycle: Session Start
| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `session-start.js` | Initialize session context, load previous state |

### Lifecycle: Pre-Tool Use (Before Edits)
| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `self-modify-gate.sh` | Prevent AI from modifying its own hook/config files |
| `circuit-breaker.sh` | Detect retry loops (3 warn / 5 restrict / 8 block thresholds) |
| `quality-gate.sh` | Wrapper for `quality-gate.js` — blocks edits that violate code standards, token compliance |

### Lifecycle: Post-Tool Use (After Actions)
| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `post-tool-track.js` | Track tool usage patterns for learning |
| `audit-trail.sh` | Append-only log of every file modification |
| `file-link-tracker.sh` | Track file references across a session |
| `gsd-context-monitor.sh` | Wrapper for `gsd-context-monitor.js` — context-usage monitoring |
| `mcp-health-check.sh` | Wrapper for `mcp-health-check.js` — flags broken/misconfigured MCP servers |
| `circuit-breaker.sh` | Also runs post-edit (same file as the pre-tool-use entry above) |

### Lifecycle: User Prompt Submit
| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `skill-activation-prompt.sh` | Wrapper for `skill-activation-prompt.js`/`.ts` — matches keywords/file patterns to skills |
| `session-logger.sh` | Persistent session history |

### Lifecycle: Pre-Compact (Before Context Compression)
| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `pre-compact.sh` | Wrapper for `pre-compact.js` — currently a stub; extend with real context-preservation logic before relying on it |

### Lifecycle: Stop (Session End)
| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `stop-finalize.js` | Save session state, generate summary |
| `session-end-log.sh` | Log session metrics and outcomes |

### Lifecycle: Notification
| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `notification.sh` | Portable notification dispatch |

### Unwired (present in `hooks/`, not in `settings-example.json`)

`activation-logger.sh`, `context-budget-tracker.ts`, `excellence-hook.sh`, `memory-check.sh`, `pre-commit.sh`, `gsd-statusline.js`/`.sh`, `gsd-workflow-guard.js`/`.sh` exist as standalone scripts but aren't referenced by the example config — wire them manually if you want them, or treat them as experimental/reference implementations.

## How It Works

### Quality Gate (Pre-Edit)

The quality gate runs before every `Edit`, `Write`, or `NotebookEdit` tool call:

```bash
# .claude/hooks/quality-gate.sh
# Triggered: PreToolUse [Edit|Write|NotebookEdit]

# Check for hardcoded colors (should use tokens)
if grep -qP '#[0-9a-fA-F]{6}' "$FILE"; then
  echo "BLOCK: Use design tokens instead of hardcoded hex colors"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Circuit Breaker (Post-Edit)

Prevents infinite retry loops:

```bash
# Tracks consecutive failures per tool
# 3 failures → WARNING
# 5 failures → RESTRICTED (suggest alternative)
# 8 failures → BLOCKED (force stop)
```

### Skill Activation (Prompt Submit)

Automatically loads relevant skills based on what you're working on:

```javascript
// Detects: file patterns (.tsx → react-patterns)
// Detects: keywords ("blog post" → article-creator)
// Detects: magic words ("ultrawork" → swarm mode)
```

## Configuration

Add hooks to your `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write|NotebookEdit",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": ".claude/hooks/quality-gate.sh" }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write|NotebookEdit|Bash",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": ".claude/hooks/audit-trail.sh" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Part of ACOS

These hooks are extracted from the [Agentic Creator OS](https://github.com/frankxai/agentic-creator-os) — a full operating system for AI coding agents with 90+ skills, 65+ commands, and 38 agents.

## Agent operating guidance

Repository agents use the shared Starlight operating contract in `AGENTS.md` alongside local instructions.
The contract asks agents to establish a useful outcome, select relevant skills, complete authorized work,
verify current sources, refine the actual artifact, and report evidence and remaining gates.
It covers human agency, privacy, rights, resource stewardship and bounded proactivity.
Repository identity, brand, canon, build commands and release gates remain local.

[Pinned contract](https://github.com/frankxai/Starlight-Intelligence-System/blob/794db1e51a55a128816f7aa266eb0ac1dbd452c3/docs/architecture/agents-md/band-a.md)
· [Projection and verification](https://github.com/frankxai/Starlight-Intelligence-System/blob/794db1e51a55a128816f7aa266eb0ac1dbd452c3/docs/architecture/AGENTS-MD-CONTRACT.md)

These files supply operating guidance. They do not activate an agent, grant tool permissions,
schedule recurring work, certify compliance or prove a live capability.
